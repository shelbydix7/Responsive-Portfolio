            My name is Shelby Dix, I was born and raised in the great state of Missouri. 
            <br>
            Where I quickly left and never looked back at age 18.
        
            I am heavily involved in a realtionship with Forensic Files (aka the greatest show ever made),
            <br>
        and as well the history of every United States President (It's odd, I'm well aware).
        <br>
        
        
        For a little bit about my music taste, my favorite top three bands are listed below:
        <ol>
            <li>Pink FLoyd</li>
            <li>Led Zepplin</li>
            <li>A$AP Rocky</li>
        </ol>

    <div class= "Hawaii" p>I also love to travel as seen to the picture to the left which was taken on a hike on a Hawiian mountain on the island of Kuaui.</p></div>
